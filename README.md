- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adelbee
- 👀 I’m interested in Food
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data science...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that solves the problem of unhealthy eating habits using Ai and machine learning models for nutritional and dietary recommendation, as well as encouraging health-conscious people to enjoy the process of being healthy by providing hedonistic but nutritional products.

- Other projects will come up later like an app that involves creating an API that connects two people with similar interests like a dating app: but in this case, it will be food, a way for companies to source local food products effectively.
 ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
